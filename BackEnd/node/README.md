# Backend

Here is some code from the SondarUk project I worked solely on. 
This is a express app running on NodeJS.
Here is the code for the users api. This allows admins to see the 
status of users and change their access level accordingly. 

Also included the auth api to allow registration and log in.

Completed project can be found [here](https://sondaruk.com).
