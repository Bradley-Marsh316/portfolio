# Backend

Here is some code used on our internal admin dashboard.
We provide a range of services for clients. This one 
is from our notification service. The main use of this
came from SondarUK as they wanted an under construction site
while the main site was being developed. We used this to store
users who requested to be notified once the site went live.
Code here will allow the sending of the emails when ready.
Deployed using the serverless framework.
